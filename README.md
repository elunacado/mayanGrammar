# Language Structure 
The language I chose for this hand-in was Mayan, but because of the complexity of this language, I'll be limiting it to the two types of present Mayas have which are Actual Present which describes an action that is taking place at the current moment the rules for this tense are as follows:
| Personal Pronoun     | Auxiliary verbs   | Mixed pronoun verbs | Verb                       | Noun|
|-----------------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|-----|
| Tene'                 | táan             | in                  |   Transitive               |Noun |
| Teche'                | táan             | a                   |   Intransitive             |     |
| Leti'e'               | táan             | u                   |                            |     |
| Tone'                 | táan             | k                   |                            |     |
| Te'exe'               | táan             | a                   |                            |     |
| Leti'obe'             | táan             | u                   |                            |     |

and  Regular present which describe actions that occur regularly, such as eating or sleeping, and for this tense, the rules are the next ones:

| Personal Pronoun      | Particle        | Mixed pronoun verbs | Verb                       | Noun |
|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------------|------|
| Tene'                 | k               | in                  |   Transitive               | Noun |
| Teche'                | k               | a                   |   Intransitive             |      |
| Leti'e'               | k               | u                   |                            |      |
| Tone'                 | k               | k                   |                            |      |
| Te'exe'               | k               | a                   |                            |      | 
| Leti'obe'             | k               | u                   |                            |      |

And my nouns for this hand-in are going to be: <br />
Já|janal|sumn|tunich|kay|python which means water|food|rope|stone|fish|python(the programming language) <br />
And some sentences that can be formed and are included as tests in my code are:
* 




And for this hand-in i'll deliver a RCFG (Restricted Context Free Grammar) which as explained by (author & definition) <br />
I've prevented any ambiguity* in RCFG by ....  <br />
And any left side recursion** by  .... <br />

*Ambiguity: <br />
**Left Side Recursion: <br />
