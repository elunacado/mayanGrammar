# Description 
The language I chose for this hand-in was Mayan, but because of the complexity of this language, I'll be limiting it to the two types of present Mayas have  which are Actualk Present which describes an action that is taking place at the current moment the rules for this tense are as follows:
| Personal Pronoun     | Auxiliary verbs   | Mixed pronoun verbs | Verb                       |
|-----------------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Tene'                 | táan*            | in                  |   Transitive               |
| Teche'                | táan*            | a                   |   Intransitive             |
| Leti'e'               | táan*            | u                   |                            |
| Tone'                 | táan*            | k                   |                            |
| Te'exe'               | táan*            | a                   |                            |
| Leti'obe'             | táan*            | u                   |                            |
